				<b>Building Customized Benefits Summary</b><br>
			<p>You can build a customized version of your own Benefits Summary. We have added a BDS "Rate
				Chart Builder" - like capability for you under Myself / My Benefits / Benefits Summary - "Build or
				maintain your own Custom Benefits Summary". Only you with the Benefits Decision Maker role
				have access to this feature.</p>
			<p>Click on the Build or maintain link, and you will be presented with a page of States and areas.
				Select the States and/or areas where you have employees or in which you or your employees
				have an interest; such as places where you plan on opening new offices. Click the "Build and
				Save Rate Chart" button, and the "CUSTOM list of plans" link will be saved and made available to
				you and all of your employees under Benefits Summary feature just above the "summary of ALL
				plans".</p>
			<p>You can come back at any time of the year to add or delete States/areas and create another
				custom list.
