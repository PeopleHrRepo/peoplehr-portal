			The Carrier Certificates are the Summary Plan Descriptions for each benefit you elect. For instance if you elected the Aetna PPO 1000, you would rely on the information contained in the Carrier Certificate below to give you plan information about specifics such as how a MRI is covered or the copay for a specialty drug. Call the carrier if you have additional questions. SBCs are easy-to-understand medical plan summaries formatted so you can evaluate and compare your plan choices. They also feature coverage examples so you can compare what your cost might be in two common medical situations. Health Care Reform requires all medical insurance companies to use a standard SBC format so you can also make comparisons between medical plans. These SBCs are available to you on behalf of your eligible dependents. If an additional copy is required for a dependent with a different address you may either copy the document or request an additional copy from the Employee Solution Center at 800.638.0461, 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT, Monday through Friday.
